# WatIsQ2
WhatIsQ2 is based on Paril's EGL 0.3.1. The aim is to improve the engine for modability.

Allowing a more easy workflow by using C++ instead of C. Adding support for other model formats, such as .iqm(TODO) and mimicking a more GoldSrc SDK code baes approach.

## Features
- All features of EGL 0.3.1 (Client and Server game .dll/.so)
- CMake
- SDL
- C++
- Linux
