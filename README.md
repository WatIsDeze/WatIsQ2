# WatIsQ2
WhatIsQ2 is based on Paril's EGL 0.3.1. The aim is to improve the engine for modability.

Allowing a more easy workflow by using C++ instead of C, mimicking a more GoldSrc SDK approach. Adding support for RmlUI as menu and HUD interface renderer. 

Planned in the near future are creating a new game MOD adding:
- improve A.I so it has squad behavior and covers flanks. 
- player friendly A.I.
- recoil effect for weapons.
- reloading weapons.

Planned engine changes in the future are:
- support for .iqm model format. (maybe?)
- possible physics(maybe?)
